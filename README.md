## About

A simple and minimalistic app designed to calculate clock-out times at work.

Features:
- Adjustable lunch period (default is 30 minutes)
- Set meeting time seperate from working hours
- Calculate total time with lost minutes
- Adjustable productivity rate (default is 95%)

I created this app based on my need to meet a productivity standard at work and because of other factors such as time lost to missed treatments, lunch breaks, and meetings, knowing when to clock out becomes quite difficult.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Materialize
